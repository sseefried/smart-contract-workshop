# Why programming?

## Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."

### -- Structure and Interpretion of Computer Programs (SICP)

# Why programming?

- It’s fun and rewarding
- Lots of opportunity
- Make things with virtually no resources<sup>*</sup>
- Solve problems
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Potential to scale
- Culture of knowledge generosity
- Fame and fortune awaits

# A word on smart contracts


- will not replace lawyers
- Will just allow them to automate boring tasks
- Short of developing AI, for complex moral judgements computers will probably never be used
- original definition by Nick Szabo meant a contract that was *self-enforcing*.

# About JavaScript

- Made in 11 days by Brendan Eich
- Not the best language, but the most ubiquitous. It's in every browser.
- Many languages compile (translate) to JavaScript - CoffeeScript, TypeScript, PureScript -- try to ‘fix’ some of the defects.

# Variables

- Variables hold *values*.

```JavaScript
var my_name = "Sean";
var my_age = 38; // yes really!
```

- Variables must be *declared* and they can be *assigned*.

```JavaScript
var my_name; // declare
my_name = "Sean"; // assignment
```

or

```JavaScript
var my_name = "Sean"; // declare and assign together;
my_name = "Shane"; // change assignment of the my_name variable
```

# Basic data types

- *string*. Represents sequence of characters e.g. `"hello"`
- *number*. Represents numeric values e.g. `100` or `1.23`
- *boolean*. Represents either `true` or `false`.
- *undefined*. All values start out undefined.

# More complicated data types

- *objects*. These map *keys* to *values*. e.g. `{ "alice": 27, "bob": 33 }`
- *arrays*. These are just lists of values. e.g. `[ 10, 20, 30 ]`
- Objects and arrays can themselves contains objects and arrays!

```JavaScript
{ "ages": { "alice": 27, "bob": 33},
  "bank_balances": { "alice": 1000, "bob": 500}
}
```
